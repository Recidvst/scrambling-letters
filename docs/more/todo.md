### To-do

1. Allow passing of elements rather than just IDs/classes, as per [Issue #4](https://github.com/Recidvst/scrambling-letters/issues/4 'Issue #4 on GitHub').
2. Use requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval.
3. 100% test coverage if possible.
4. Review options for better handling of nested tags.

> I am planning a refactor of the package in the near future to improve the code quality, so will look to handle some of the above at the same time.
